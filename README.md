### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year software engineering student at Concordia University. 

I'm skilled in Java, Javascript, Typescript, C# and C++. 

My pronouns are He/Him.

#### What I'm interested in

My main interest is web development. I mostly focus on the backend, but I can get by in the frontend too. 

I also have a casual interest in game programming, and that's how I learned to code when I started in 2016.

#### What I'm working on

Right now, I'm the team lead for [Switchboard](https://github.com/bean-pod/switchboard), my team's Capstone project at Concordia. It's a web service that enables peer-to-peer video streaming between senders and receivers.

#### I've done a couple of internships

* AppDirect (Summer 2020) Backend development in the Payments team.
* Coveo (Summer 2019) Frontend development in the Salesforce Integration team.
* Genetec (Fall 2018) Software developer in the Device Integrations team.

#### I'm the president of SCS Concordia

SCS is the software engineering and computer science society at Concordia. As the president, I mostly organize our meetings, recruit new people, seek new initiatives for the society, and help everyone out. I also gave workshops on Git.
