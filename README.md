### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a degree in Software Engineering from Concordia University. 

I'm skilled in Java, Javascript, Typescript, C# and C++. 

My pronouns are He/Him.

#### What I'm interested in

My main interest is web development. I mostly focus on the backend, but I can get by in the frontend too. 

I also have a casual interest in game programming, and that's how I learned to code when I started in 2016. My current project is called Earthrite, a mix between the deckbuilder and farming simulator genres - [you can go play it here!](https://github.com/felixlapierre/farmingDeckbuilder/)

#### What I'm working on

Right now, I'm a Senior Software Developer at Slalom Build ðŸš€

Before that, I worked at AppDirect as a Software Developer on the Core Billing team (2021-2024)

#### I've done a couple of internships

* AppDirect (Summer 2020) Backend development in the Payments team.
* Coveo (Summer 2019) Frontend development in the Salesforce Integration team.
* Genetec (Fall 2018) Software developer in the Device Integrations team.

#### I was involved with SCS Concordia

SCS is the software engineering and computer science society at Concordia. I was the president of the society for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years. Before that, I was VP Academic for the 2018-2019 academic year. As the president, I mostly organized our meetings, recruited new people, sought new initiatives for the society, and helped everyone out. I also gave workshops on Git.
